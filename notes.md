##User Stories
 * I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.
 * I want to view a list of foods I have logged.
 * I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
 * I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365).

##Objectives
 * Does the application work as expected?
 * Is the app structured in a logical way, including a model, multiple components and TypeScript? (Interfaces are not required).
 * Can the application create and edit new instances of a model?
 * Does the app allow you to view a list of foods?
 * Can the application filter foods based on their calories?
 * Are dependencies managed with npm and Bower?
 * Does the app include a gulp-based asset pipeline with a development server?
 * Does code meet standards from previous weeks?
 * Is the project in a presentable, portfolio-quality state?
 * Project demonstrates understanding of concepts covered this week. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.
